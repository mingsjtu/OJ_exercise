# OJ_exercise
This year, the author is aquired by the School of Software, Tsinghua University,and got the oppotunity to have a parttime job as an algorithm engineer in ByteDance. Here is the JIKAO coding exercise .All codes are in C++,which is the aquirement of Tsinghua University. 
# OJ_Recommondation
for students sick to join THU or PKU:
POJ http://poj.org/
for students sick to get a job:
Leetcode https://leetcode-cn.com/
## Knowlege tree
### Data structure
tree, graph, stl:vector,stl:list,stl:map
### Algorithm
Dynamic plan,greedy,enumerate,BFS,DFS
### Math
Similar to number theory

# For readers
Most of the cpp files have been created using Visual Studio IDE, and others using Codeblocks IDE. 
## The codes questions contains
### In dir named by an exam (especially of PKU)
You can find them here http://bailian.openjudge.cn
### In [poj刷题](https://github.com/mingsjtu/OJ_exercise/tree/master/poj刷题) dir
You can find them here http://poj.org/
It is the largest dir , and contains various types of questions arranged in different dirs.
And the reference questions number is here in docs https://github.com/mingsjtu/OJ_exercise/blob/master/poj刷题/参考题.docx
### In [noi](https://github.com/mingsjtu/OJ_exercise/tree/master/noi) dir
You can find them here http://noi.openjudge.cn/
### In [zoj刷题](https://github.com/mingsjtu/OJ_exercise/tree/master/zoj刷题) dir
You can find them here https://zoj.pintia.cn/home
Them may be a little bit difficult than poj刷题
### In [牛客OI](https://github.com/mingsjtu/OJ_exercise/tree/master/牛客OI) dir
You can find them here https://www.nowcoder.com/
A different part of them is that they are in OI form, which is more similar with the coding test in Tsinghua University.
### In [王道](https://github.com/mingsjtu/OJ_exercise/tree/master/王道) dir 
You can find them in the book "王道计算机考研机试指南"
I highly recommend you to read it, and I learnt most of the algorithm and data structure knowledge within it.
### In [NOIP骗分](https://github.com/mingsjtu/OJ_exercise/tree/master/NOIP骗分) dir 
You can find them in the book "NOIP骗分指南"
It is much more difficult than "王道" . If you have finished "王道" learning , you can choose this one for learn.

### Attension
Not all cpp files can promise to be completely right. And you can sure find a more suitable algorithm for most questions . If so , please contact me , thanks.
Following the OJ tests recommended by this repository ,and I hope you will get to receive the offer from you dream schools or companys.
